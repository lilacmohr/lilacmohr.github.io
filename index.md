# I help engineering teams ship faster — without sacrificing quality.

I’m **Lilac Mohr**, an **AI Enablement Leader** who helps organizations operationalize AI across the software delivery lifecycle.

Most teams don’t have an “AI problem.” They have a **systems problem**:
- AI is adopted unevenly (a few power users, the rest blocked)
- Tooling creates risk (security, IP, data exposure) and slows adoption
- Wins aren’t repeatable (one-off prompts and demos that don’t scale)
- Leaders can’t measure impact (no instrumentation, no baselines, no outcomes)

## What I do

I build **AI-first engineering systems** that turn ad-hoc usage into **repeatable patterns**:

- **Reduce SDLC toil** with pragmatic automations (triage, investigations, test generation, release workflows)
- **Standardize team workflows** so AI assistance is consistent across repos, services, and squads
- **Instrument outcomes** (cycle time, PR throughput, incident load, defect escape rate, onboarding time)
- **Enable responsibly** with guardrails: access controls, approved tools, policy, and risk containment

## The deliverables you can expect

- **Playbooks**: step-by-step interventions for high-friction engineering workflows  
- **Frameworks**: governance + adoption models that scale beyond early enthusiasts  
- **Case studies**: patterns, architecture, rollout strategy, and measured results

### If you’re leading engineering and trying to scale AI beyond experiments:
Start with **Playbooks** → build repeatability → instrument results → expand safely.
